# Week 2
## Plan
- Introductions + Administrivia
- General algorithmic coding introduction
- Interview coding norms
- Linked lists practice
- Other practice
- [Some divide and conquer practice]
- Notes on runtime analysis

## Introductions + Administrivia
- Discussion will always focus on coding rather than worksheet. Same time, same place every week. Feedback/suggestions are extremely welcome and beneficial - sessions adapt to your feedback! **http://tinyurl.com/170lcfeedback**
- Repo: **https://github.com/zenanana/CS170Spring24** (will also add to Ed post) 
- Introduce yourselves to those sitting around you! (What are you excited about this semester? Does CS170 content seem interesting to you so far? What has been your experience with coding questions/interviews/internship-hunting)
- How comfortable are you with coding questions and interviews?
- Any struggles you came across while practicing coding questions/during interviews?

## General algorithmic coding introduction
- You've heard of mathematical maturity, algorithmic thinking is similar
- Break down problems into smaller components
- Identify key patterns in each component (LRU/LFU cache are classic examples)
- Practice and exposure are crucial

## Interview coding norms
- In interviews: there is always a general structure: pre-amble, coding, analysis, [optimizations]
- Format is not like LeetCode!
- The interviewer is an asset (and a human)
- Think before you do, speak while you do
- (As always) Practice and exposure are crucial

## Notes on runtime analysis
- Big picture, and then line-by-line if needed
- Usually big O is enough
- But... you might not be able to always ignore constants now!

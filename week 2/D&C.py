Main idea of D&C: break big problem into smaller ones. Solve each independently.
With enough practice, D&C should come naturally without much explicit thought. This is also true because a lot of coding questions use D&C innately.

# Problem 1: Given an unsorted array of numbers and an integer k, write a function that finds the kth smallest element of the array. 
# Example: [1, 3, 4, 2, 5], k = 2 -> 4





# Problem 1.1: What is the runtime?

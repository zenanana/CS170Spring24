## Design Questions
- (Different from SysDesign questions! We might run over those later in the semester if there is interest)
- Similar to general coding questions, but larger in scope
- Lengthier, but essentially test the same skills - data structures & algorithms
- Excellent place to follow the principle of "breaking into smaller components"
- Very common in interviews/OAs

## Testing
- Multiple types: unit, integration, end-to-end, etc.
- Always unit test your code if possible (well-formed input, ill-formed input, edge cases, etc.)

# Reminders
- Clarifying questions (impressive)
- Unit tests (very impressive)

# Others
- Good resource: https://neetcode.io/practice
- Goal: onsight ~90% of LC mediums in under 15/20 mins

# Courses (UD)
- For SWE: CS61C (CS162) > CS170 > CS186 >> CS161/CS168 >>>>> everything else
- For ML/research: idk
- CS169: this is what you're supposed to learn during the internship

# Thoughts
- A lot of coding interviews is just practice and regurgitation. But I like to think that works in our favor.
- SWE is overrated: other options rock too
- Show plenty of personality
- Don't beat yourself up if you fail
- Eat well, hydrate plenty, exercise often -- stay healthy :\)

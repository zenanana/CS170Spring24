# My Strategy
## Preparation
- Jot down/type up answers to a few common behavioral questions (e.g. "Tell me about yourself", "Tell me about a time you had a conflict with someone else", etc.)
- Use the STAR method! 
- Remember the general structure and points of your answers (no need to memorize them!)
- Be ready to tweak your answers on the spot to handle different questions
    - Your answer to "Tell me about a time you failed" can be tweaked and used for "Tell me about a time you went out of your comfort zone" or "Tell me about a time you learnt from an unsuccessful project"
- Prepare meaningful questions to ask interviewers
    - One of my favorites is "If an intern were to join your team, what would be considered a successful internship for you?"
## During the Interview
- Start off warm but also try to match your interviewer's energy! 
    - If they're pretty laid back, treating the interview as more of a conservation where you can joke and laugh may help
- Use your prepared answers and STAR method!
- It is okay to pause... after hearing a question!
- Ask the meaningful questions you prepared, but also ask meaningful questions that relates to the interviewer
    - If the interviewer is an SRE, ask about how they handle Disaster Recovery
    - If the interviewer is a SWE at an asset manager, ask how commerciality and engineering excellence is balanced
    - If the interviewer is from Roblox, ask how they were involved in the 73-hour outage in 2021 (good idea to research the company a bit before the interview!)
## Practice and Experience
- It takes many interviews to even begin to start to feel comfortable with them
- If you feel like you're not comfortable enough with interviews, try to get more mileage under your belt
## Most Importantly
- Be a respectable human being!
    - If you were the interviewer, would you want to take on an intern that is blatantly arrogant, mannerless and crass?
